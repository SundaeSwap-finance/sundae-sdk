# CLI Package for Sundae SDK

This CLI package provides tools to interact with the SundaeSwap Dex.

## Installation

To install the CLI package, use the following command:

```bash
bun run build
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start the tool by using the following command:
```bash
bun ./packages/cli/dist/cli/index.js
```

## Configuration

The CLI will store settings in a `settings.json` file located in your home directory at `~/.sundaeswap-cli/settings.json`. Normally there is no need to edit this file manually as any missing settings will be prompted from the user. In the main menu you can choose the settings sub menu to change any settings later on.
