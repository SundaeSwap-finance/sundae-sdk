# functions

```go
import "."
```

Gofmt formats Go programs. It uses tabs for indentation and blanks for alignment. Alignment assumes that an editor is using a fixed\-width font.

Without an explicit path, it processes the standard input. Given a file, it operates on that file; given a directory, it operates on all .go files in that directory, recursively. \(Files starting with a period are ignored.\) By default, gofmt prints the reformatted sources to standard output.

Usage:

```
gofmt [flags] [path ...]
```

The flags are:

```
-d
    Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
    If a file's formatting is different than gofmt's, print diffs
    to standard output.
-w
    Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
    If a file's formatting is different from gofmt's, overwrite it
    with gofmt's version. If an error occurred during overwriting,
    the original file is restored from an automatic backup.
```

When gofmt reads from standard input, it accepts either a full Go program or a program fragment. A program fragment must be a syntactically valid declaration list, statement list, or expression. When formatting such a fragment, gofmt preserves leading indentation as well as leading and trailing spaces, so that individual sections of a Go program can be formatted by piping them through gofmt.
