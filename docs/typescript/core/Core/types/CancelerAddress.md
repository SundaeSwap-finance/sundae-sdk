# CancelerAddress

> `string`

The optional alternate address that can cancel the Escrow order. This is
needed because a [DestinationAddress](DestinationAddress.md) can be a Script Address. This
is useful to chain swaps with other protocols if desired, while still allowing
a consistently authorized alternate to cancel the Escrow.
